    <p>My name is Hannes Kirsman and I'm HTML/CSS expert. I've sliced and synced (connect with Wordpress or other CMS's)
    hundreds of sites (in about 10 years).</p>

    <p>
      About 2 years ago I started to reserch tools and tricks to get better and faster results at my field of expertise.
    </p>

    <p>I stumpled upon <a href="http://staticmatic.rubyforge.org/">StaticMatic</a>
    that uses <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">HAML</a> as templating language.</p>

    <p>
      I loved the idea(!) but could not use it. I needed to write HTML not HAML.
      I needed a tool that would simplify my work and would not hinder me. Thus I started experimenting with Smarty.
      I wondered, what if I could use this amazing templating language for my need? What if could use Smarty to output static HTML?

    <p>
      It turned out it can be done. Now it's here - not complete, probably buggy,
      missing lot features that the open source community has to figure out ;)
    </p>

    <p>
      I am using Smarty every day so it's ready to be used by others.
