HTML Warrior user templates
======================

These are default user templates ment for reuse  
in projects.  

These should be automatically copied to site  
templates dir if for example {partial tpl="youtube"}  
would be called and it doesn't exist in sites  
templates directory.  For now such a feature is  
broken.
