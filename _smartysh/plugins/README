These are plugins for easy adding to your site.

I haven't yet figured out how to make it matter of clicking to enable or disable plugins.

For now, you have to manually uncomment or add it to sites cfg ( example_site\cfg\config.php ) and copy files content to your site ( _smartysh\plugins\jquery.hrzAccordion\files\ )

Overall, plugins should be something that's in Wordpress. Users should be able to share them.
