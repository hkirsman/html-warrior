.... how can I use wiki syntax here? anyways, lets get started


Intro

I'm a HTML/CSS expert. About an year ago I was working on 50+ page design ( yes, more than 50 pages of HTML ). This project needed constant changing so I was asked: "Can't I use javascript or something similar to replace that 1 thing repeating on all 50+ pages?" I sai: "No, there is no solution. It's static HTML."

Today, I'm happy to announce Smartysh - tool that builds static HTML out of templates.

Smartysh is based on Smarty ( http://www.smarty.net/ ) templating system.

Download Smartysh, unpack it to c:\www ( for example ), run c:\www\smartysh\servers\server2go\Server2Go.exe and browse to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ or http://YOUR_IP:8080/ Choose example_site and start reading

Smartysh uses 3 types of templates: layout - the outermost template (head, body) page - html that gets wrapped inside layout partial - small (no size limit here :) ) template sniplets like youtube, form elements, images.

I like the image partial. It can take parameters like alt, width, height and ofcourse source. If you omit height and/or with, it outputs img tag with the correct dimensions.

There's not limit to what kind of templates you want to have. Infact, you can use Smartysh and not use it's features at all which would be kind of silly :)
