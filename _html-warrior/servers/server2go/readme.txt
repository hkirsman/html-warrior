What is Server2Go
------------------------------
Server2Go is a CD-ROm Webserver. That means it is a webserver that can run directly from cdrom without installation. Server2Go allows you to create a working web site or PHP application on a CD-ROM. Using a web browser, a user can run php programs as well as view html files on the CD-ROM. He only need to insert a CD with Server2Go under the supported Windows operations systems. The server starts automaticly and opens a browser with the Website of the CD-ROM

Server2Go supports PHP5, SQLite and MySQL.

Licence
------------------------------
Server2Go is Donationware. That means you can download and use it for free and you don't have to pay any royalty charges when distribute an application on CD-ROM that uses Server2Go. But if you use it commercially or like to keep it free available you should donate to the project. How to donate? Just take a look at the donation page. There are a lot of inexpensive possibilities to help.
Every donator that is donating more then 10.- Euro is getting a user id and password with that he can download additional software that is not public available. See the download page for details.
